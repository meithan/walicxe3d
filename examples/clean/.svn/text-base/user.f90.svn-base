!< @brief User-specified initial and boundary conditions
!< @details This is the file where the user sets the initial conditions of
!! the simulation, as well as any special boundary conditions or custom
!! modifications to the simulation.
!!
!! How to use this module:
!!   1) Add "use" statements to include any modules you require in the
!!      section marked [1].
!!   2) You can define aditional module-wide global variables and parameters
!!      in the section marked [2].
!!   3) Fill in the subroutine userInitialCondition(), marked [3], which
!!      is called at the beginning of the simulation.
!!   4) Optionally, fill in the subroutine userBoundary(), marked [4],
!!      which is called at the end of each boundary exchange operation.
!!
!! All subroutines in this module automatically have access to the global
!! parameters and variables.

  ! [3] USER-DEFINED INITIAL CONDITIONS
  !
  !< @brief User-defined Initial Conditions
  !< @details This subroutine is called at the beginning of the simulation,
  !! after the base grid is built and a basic uniform initial condition
  !! is imposed. It is to be modified by the user to define the problem-
  !! specific Initial Condition.
  !!
  !! IMPORTANT: This subroutine receives the FLOW variables array to be 
  !! modified as argument 'uvars'. The subroutine must modify this array,
  !! *NOT* the global arrays U, UP or PRIMS.
  !!
  !! The array has the following structure:
  !!   uvars ( block ID, equation number, cell_i, cell_j, cell_k )
  !! where the equation numbering is:
  !!   1: rho
  !!   2: rho*u
  !!   3: rho*v
  !!   4: rho*w
  !!   5: E (kinetic+thermal)
  !! If the passive magnetic field is enabled:
  !!   6: B_x
  !!   7: B_y
  !!   8: B_z
  !! If passive scalars are enabled, they begin after all other flow
  !! variables (i.e., 9+ if passive B-field enabled, 6+ if not).
  !!
  !! Note that the cell indices include ghost cells. For instance, if we
  !! had a 1-deep ghost cell layer then cells from 1 to ncells_x would be
  !! physical cells, while cells 0 and ncells_x+1  would be ghost cells.

  ! [4] USER-DEFINED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
  !
  !< @brief User-defined Boundary Conditions
  !< @details This subroutine is called once per timestep *after* standard
  !! boundary have been applied to all blocks. It allows the user to
  !! to impose an arbitrary boundary condition on the simulation.
  !!
  !! IMPORTANT: This subroutine receives the FLOW variables array to be 
  !! modified as argument 'uvars'. The subroutine must modify this array,
  !! *NOT* the global arrays U and UP.
  !!
  !! The structure of this array is described in the userInitialConditions()
  !! subroutine documentation above.
