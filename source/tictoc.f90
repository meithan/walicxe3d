!> @brief Benchmarking functions
!> @details Contains functions and subroutines designed to measure
!! the execution time between points in the program execution.
!> @section changelog Changelog
!! @li @b 1.5
!! @c TOC now returns a real with the number of elapsed seconds, and two
!! new functions were added: @c FTIME accepts a real representing a
!! time span in seconds, and returns a character string with hours, minutes
!! and seconds, as needed. @c NICETOC receives an @c INTEGER time mark, passes it
!! to toc, and then returns the result of timeformat, i.e., a formatted
!! character string represented the time elapsed.
!! @li @b 1.4
!! Some subroutines were converted into functions that return
!! a character string instead of printing the result to screen.
!! @li @b 1.3
!! The subroutine @c ETA was added. It allows to estimate the remaining
!! execution time based on a user provided progress estimator.
!! @li @b 1.2
!! The intrinsic @c SYSTEM_CLOCK is now used instead of
!! @c DATE_AND_TIME to calculate time intervals. See Comments.
!! @li @b 1.1
!! @c STAMP was added to generate nicely formatted timestamps.
!! @li @b 1.0
!! First version.
!> @section comments Comments
!! Starting from version 1.2, the module utilizes @c SYSTEM_CLOCK
!! instead of @c DATE_AND_TIME because it provides higher time
!! resolution. The disadvantage of this is that @c SYSTEM_CLOCK
!! has a relatively small looparound period, which is compiler-dependent.
!! For the GCC 4.2.1, this value is 24.855 days, so trying to measure
!! a time interval larger than this will produce incorrect results.
!! @n @n This program measures wall time.
!! @section usage Module Usage
!! Time measurements are done with the function pair @c TIC and @c TOC.
!! One must first call @c TIC to mark a certain point in the execution
!! of the program, and then @c TOC can be called at any later time in
!! order to calculate the elapsed time since the moment marked by @c TIC.
!! @n @n
!! Subroutine @c TIC modifies the given @c INTEGER argument @c mark storing
!! information about the point in time when it was called. Multiple
!! time marks (one variable per mark) can be used in the program to mark
!! different points. Time resolution is system dependent but is generally
!! on the order of milliseconds. 
!! @n @n
!! The @c ETA function estimates the execution time remaining. It must
!! be given a real number between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage
!! progress of the execution at the moment of the call, as well as a time
!! mark obtained at the program start.
!! @n @n
!! The @c STAMP function returns a string with the current date and time.
!! It is common to call @c STAMP together with a call to @c TOC.
